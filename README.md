In this lab, we stored the data in google drive, which we then mounted into a shared collab to perform the training, This made the work flow pretty eficient, and the size of the data was not big enough to cause problems on our drive spaces.
 
We improve the model performance using model-centric approach.
-tune hyperparameters:
 -fp16 greatly improves the speed of traning (available only on GPU).
